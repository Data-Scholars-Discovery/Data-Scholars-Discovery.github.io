# For Teachers

The Data Scholars program at the University of California, Berkeley aims to foster a community of inclusive learning for students from diverse backgrounds with a passion for data science.
The focus of the program are the seminars, which are structured in three levels: Foundations, Pathways, and Discovery.

## Foundations


## Pathways


## Discovery


# Pedagogy of the Discovery Seminar

The goal of the seminar is to establish a fun, trusting, and collaborative learning environment for students to support each other as they apply data science skills to "real world" problems.
The seminar accompanies an applied research project with an established academic team on campus. Students are expected to become meaningful contributors to their project over the course of the semester.

Class sessions are focused on creating an open dialogue between students on their project experience, while also supporting independent and group learning of new data science abilities.
The activities of the course are divided between 4 categories:
* Project Support
* Professional Development
* Hands On Skill Building
* Group Projects and Presentations

# Using the Discovery Resources

All materials for the Discovery seminar are included here in the GitHub Repo.
The facilitator of the course is expected to take a "hands-off" approach, allowing students to explore, make mistakes, and learn according to their own initiative.
The guiding principle for the facilitator is to help students to develop their own abilities, not to try to impart particular knowledge.

Discovery facilitators are encouraged to review liberation pedagogy practices prior to organizing a seminar:

# Creating a Discovery Community

All those engaged in creating open spaces for learning data science are encouraged to contribute to this open-source Discovery Guide.
If you create new activities, materials, or resources for your course we encourage you to share them here so everyone can appreciate them!
