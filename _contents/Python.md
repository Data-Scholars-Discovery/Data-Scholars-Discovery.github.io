Python is one of the most used programming languages in data science. It is open-source, has powerful tools, and has an array of user-interfaces and user-created packages for any sort of task. We recommend it for anyone who plans to integrate data science into a broader programming skill set, or who plans to work with other computer-oriented folks. The Anaconda suite of user interfaces contains both Jupyter Notebooks and Spyder, two common programs for working in Python that we recommend for everyone using Python.
